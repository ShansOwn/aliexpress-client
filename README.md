# aliexpress-client
## Published temporally for code review only
#### One of the microservices of my unfinished pet project
This project was created mostly for getting acquaintance with Spring 5.0 reactive stack and some fun.

#### Main Stack
- Java 8
- Spring Boot 2.0
- Spring WebFlux
- Project Reactor
- Spring Data JPA
- Postgresql

#### Tests stack
- Groovy
- Spock Framework
- H2

There is still a lack of tests, especially over the reactive stack.
Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time.
But I'll do it someday. I hope...

#### Note
Because of design as a part of the spring cloud project, you will get a bunch of error messages from the Discovery client.
Nevertheless, it should work.
